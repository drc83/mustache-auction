Being that we\'re a development shop that loves open source, it\'s also <a href="https://github.com/stevegrunwell/mustache-auction" rel="external">available for free on Github</a> for your own mustache-related needs.</p>
  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <p>Each of these brave men have agreed to auction their mustache style off to help raise money for the cause. You can pledge money to any of the mustache choices (or, if you\'re feeling generous, put your money on "Mo\' Bro\'s Choice" and cut him some slack). At the end of the auction period each man will [attempt to] grow the mustache style that brought in the most money.</p>
  <p>No actual money is exchanged at the time pledges are made but each Mo\' Bro will receive a list of totals for each donor; he will contact you via the email address used to create your account to arrange payments through his Movember.com profile page. You may also view your pledge history at any time by visiting your account settings page.</p>
  <h2>About Movember</h2>
  <p>Movember is a month-long event to raise awareness of and money for men\'s health issues, including prostate and testicular cancers. Men ("Mo\' Bros") grow out mustaches as they and the women in their lives ("Mo\' Sistas") raise money for men\'s health-related charities.
